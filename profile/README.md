### Hi Little Trees! Welcome Onboard!

Welcome to our space dedicated to small trees—bonsais! Here, you’ll find information, care tips, and inspiration to nurture these wonders of nature. Feel free to explore and share your passion for bonsais.

Our main mission is to spread the culture of bonsai and provide a space for enthusiasts, beginners, and experts alike.

Our goals with this project are:
- **Share Knowledge:** Provide detailed information on growing, caring for, and styling bonsais, regardless of experience level.
- **Encourage Community:** Create a space where bonsai lovers can share their experiences, photos, and tips, forming an active and collaborative community.
- **Open Source and Collaboration:** The project will be fully open source, allowing others to contribute improvements, fixes, and new features. We believe in the power of collaboration.
